# Team Profile Generator READme


## Description
The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, that then generates an HTML webpage to quickly display summaries for each team member. Clicking on an employee's email address in the generated page opens the default email program and populates the "To:" field of the email with the employee's address. Similarly clicking on an engineer's GitHub username opens their GitHub profile in a new tab. The application is meant to be used by a team manager and takes in at least their information before prompting and allowing them to add team members to the team before selecting they have finished building their time which then generates their html.
